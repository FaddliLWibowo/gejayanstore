                  Tooltips need the attribute role="tooltip" so assistive devices understand what they are. On the text connected to the tooltip, you need the attribute aria-describedby, where the value is the ID of the tooltip it's connected to. Lucky for you, our JavaScript handles all of this for you!
                  The only markup change you'll need to make is adding the attribute aria-haspopup="true" to your tooltip text. It's helpful for screen readers, and it also makes tooltips easier to use on Windows 8 touch devices.
